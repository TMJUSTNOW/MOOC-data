Goal: relate forum "satisfaction" to course engagement.
Approach:
    We focus on users who start a thread and measures their
forum satisfaction by looking at quality of responses (votes),
quantity of responses (or whether they get a response at all) 
and speed of response.

Data format:

Each row corresponds to a user who "opened" a thread.
There are 33,079 rows in total
